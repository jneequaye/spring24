    <h3>by Jerry Liston</h3>

    <b>“Grandmas and grandpas are grand-angels.” ~ Terri Guillemets.</b>

    <p>The greatest things about my grandparents are the life lessons that remain long after they are gone. As little as I was, my mom and dad were constantly traveling all over the world due to the nature of their work. My grandparents played a significant role in my upbringing.</p>

    <p>Oneday, I gave them unique nicknames such as <i><b>"Wisdom and Understanding".</b></i> Grandpa was "Wisdom" and Grandma was "Understanding". Many family and friends called them by these unique names and they loved it. <i>They always advised me to be truthful, loyal, humble, and respectful irrespective of anyone I encounter in this life.</i> Their source of encouragement to me was incredible. The favorite colors of my grannies were blue.</p>

    <p>My spirit was always boasted when I saw them during my dancing competition days at elementary school. I won one of the most popular dancing and soccer competitions at my school when they showed up. I believe that was miraculous!. I also believe they were Angels. My Grannies were such an inspiration to me.</p>
