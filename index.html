    <h3>by Jerry Liston</h3>
    <p>The greatest things about my grandparents are the life lessons that remain long after they are gone. As little as I was, my mom and dad were constantly traveling all over the world due to the nature of their work. My grandparents played a significant role in my upbringing.</p>
    <p>Oneday, I gave them unique nicknames such as <i><b>"Wisdom and Understanding".</b></i> Grandpa was "Wisdom" and Grandma was "Understanding". Many family and friends called them by these unique names and they loved it. They always advised me to be truthful, loyal, humble, and respectful irrespective of anyone I encounter in this life. Their source of encouragement to me was incredible.</p>
    <p>My spirit was always boasted when I saw them during my dancing competition days at elementary school. I won one of the most popular dancing and soccer competitions at my school when they showed up. I believe that was miraculous!.I also believe they were Angels sent from God. They were such an inspiration to me.</p>
    <p><i>"Wisdom and Understanding".</i>Your Legacy Lives On.</p>
